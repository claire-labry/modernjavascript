If you're taking a look at this repository, this repo is for me to practice and fine tune my skills in Javascript under Brad Traversy's course in Udemy 'Modern Javascript from The Beginning'

This course allows different levels of understanding of javascript, such as beginnger learning to advanced to just brush up skills.

This repository contains all of my notes on how I understand Javascript to be and practicing the language in building javascript based applications. 

If you are learning about javascript and struggle to learn where the best place to start, I would highly suggest you check out the udemy course as it has helped me extensively.
